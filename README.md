# Code for Compressive Sensing and Denoising using Ramanujan Fourier Transform


Here you can find the code to build the Ramanujan Matrix and do the compressive sensing and denoising of images.
The blogpost at https://archana1998.github.io/project/compressive-sensing/ has detailed explanations regarding the implementations
